<p><span class="goth">Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Mining, Data Visualization - these are all names for Statistical Data Analysis, which has become popular in recent years. 

<p>There are many software used for statistical analysis, e.g. R, SAS, MATLAB, SPSS, and Stata to name a few.

<p>R is a free-to-use, open source language for high-performance computing.  It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="goth">Install R
<p>You could download the package from <a href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a> </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>You could install epel-release and then install R. R is present in EPEL(Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository.</p>
<p>R has a lot of dependencies, I found it is not easy to install from the source code.&nbsp; So for my project I do the simple way</p>

<p><span class="comic">sudo yum install R</p>
<p><span class="comic">sudo yum install epel-release</p>

<p>After R is installed, you could make a directory for storing your work in Linux
<p><span class="comic">mkdir mywork
<p>use setwd() to set your working directory and getwd() to see the working directory.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="goth">Syntax of R is similar like unix|linux
<p>R is case sensitive
<p>R default prompt is >
<p>R commands are separated either by ";" or newline.
<p>If command is not complete at the end of a line R will give a different prompt, by default is +
<p>Use vertical arrow keys to scroll forward and backward through a command history

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="goth">To get help: use help function or question mark

<p>><span class="comic">help(plot)

<p>><span class="comic">?plot

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="goth">R workspace is stored collection of objects
